# Blood-Buddy
An AI based Blood Donation App

Abstract
----------
Blood Buddy is a blood donation app which uses predictive analysis to predict the persons most likely to donate blood at the time of emergency. The time required to find a blood donor can be the difference between life and death, more so in case of rare blood groups. This led to the idea of blood buddy, a blood donation platform which aims to eliminate this time delay (which may be caused in searching for donors or non cooperation between blood banks and hospitals) by using a Machine Learning algorithm to recognize the people who is most likely to donate blood and can be reached in the least amount of time. This will be done by using a responsive web app integrated with the Machine Learning solution and will work on the behavioral data set produced by the users to give most likely donor.This will lead to reduction in time and also make it easy for people with rare blood groups.
